# Self-Driving-Cars-Object-Detection
1. Developed a self-driving car object detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
2. Trained the CNN model on a large dataset of images of roads and driving conditions to accurately detect and classify objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
3. Achieved high accuracy in object detection and classification, ensuring safe and reliable autonomous driving.
4. Documented the project with code and detailed explanations, demonstrating technical skills in deep learning and computer vision.
